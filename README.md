**Japan - 2022**

I created this project because before 2020 came around with the pandemic I really wanted to go visit Japan
and with that I wanted to create an app in which would have easy to find cards with information on some foods
and locations in Japan that I might want to see. 

Thus came about this simple app that was made in React 

An intial home page is where you first land on the app with a Navbar incase you want to just explore the app that way through each of the pages

The home page has a video playing in the background of page and a marquee with a fun "LETS GO TO JAPAN" message as a small top banner

As you scroll down the home page you find interactive cards that if you click on will lead you to either locations or foods you might want to look and read up on

**Foods**

I created a place holder footer at the bottom of the home page to simulate a footer that if you wanted more information on the app and other informations
at the bottom.

Each card leads to the respective pages on the app which have a list of locations and foods lined up for the client to read about

The information is to give ideas about foods you might want to try in Japan or locations you might find interesting and visit.
